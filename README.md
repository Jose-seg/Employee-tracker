# Employee-tracker

## Description 
This app runs in the backend and demonstrates my capabilities of building an employee tracker. This assignment helped me grasped a better understanding for how routes are handled and how retrieve neccessary data through these routes. I was able to get a better understanding of more complicated ways of building the database and who to store as well as present that data.

## Usage
The purpose of this app is to provide the user with a series of prompts that allow the user to view all data in certain categories such as departments, employees, and roles. A user can also add a department and add an employee, and if needed to the user can update an employee's information in the instance that employee recieved a promotion.
